## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patch versions (e.g., 1.0.1, 1.0.2, etc.) for the latest minor version. We recommend always using the latest version to ensure you have the most recent security fixes.

## Best Practices

When using this action in your workflows:

1. Always pin to a specific version rather than using `latest`
2. Regularly update to the latest version to receive security patches
3. Review the changelog before updating to understand any breaking changes
4. Use GitHub's security features like Dependabot to automatically receive security updates
